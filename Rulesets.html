                <h1>What are the rules of a Nuzlocke?</h1>
                <p class="WordsWordsWords">The exact rules of a Nuzlocke vary from person to person, and that's ok, because not everyone needs to play the exact same because it is a self-imposed challenge, but the most follow the following core rules, and may throw in some extras.</p>
                <ol id="Rules" class="WordsWordsWords">
                    <li>Permadeath</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Generally this means that if ever a Pokemon faints (eg. if it's HP reaches 0) then that Pokemon can never be used in battle again, and must be permanently boxed or released at the soonest opporotunity.</li>
                            <li>Some players allow for a certain number of "hail marys" so to speak, where you can revive a dead Pokemon once per run/gym or at the expense of another 1 or few Pokemon.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Limited Encounters</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In most nuzlockes this means only being allowed to catch the first Pokemon encountered on a route, in a monotype or mono-shiny challenge that would mean the first Pokemon to meet whatever qualifications set.</li>
                            <li>For certain people, static encounters and gift Pokemon (including eggs) are counted as "bonus" and can be caught/recieved regardless of any prior Pokemon obtained on the route.</li>
                            <li>The area where a Pokemon is recieved is usually determined by what it says on the status screen of the Pokemon.</li>
                            <li>Most People also count Pokemon (and evolution lines) they have already caught as "duplicates" and under "dupes clause" are not allowed to catch it, and may encounter Pokemon again until they find a non-duplicate</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Nicknaming Pokemon</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Many people play with a rule to always nickname their Pokemon, to get more emotionally attached to them (or just for fun). Many people choose to forgoe however, this as it provides no additional difficulty unless you get really attached to your Pokemon.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
                <p class="WordsWordsWords">Additionally, many people also choose to play with the extra "hardcore" rules, or any combinations of different rules as they see fit.</p>
                <ol id="Rules" class="WordsWordsWords">
                    <li>Play on "Set Mode"</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In the options medu one can change from "Switch" mode to "Set" mode, the only difference being whether or not the game asks you if you want to make a free switch after knocking out an enemy Pokemon. Set mode is the harder (and more fair) option, so many opt to use it.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Play with level caps</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Level caps are where the player does not allow their Pokemon to be at a level higher than that of the next gym battle or boss fight (evil team leader/rival). This is to prevent the optimal play from ever being just leveling to 100 at the first opporotunity and then sweeping the game, you need to be on a roughly even playing field as the AI opponents. It also promotes "exp management" so that you need to think about how much exp a Pokemon can get before overleveling.</li>
                            <li>What is done with an overleveled Pokemon is ultimately up to the player, many say that they can no longer be used until the next level cap is unlocked, others may just consider the Pokemon dead right there and then.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Ban the use of in-battle items</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Usually, items such as potions and x-attacks can be used in battle, but many consider them too strong as they are basically better alternatives to healing/stat boosting moves without the drawback of a move slot. The AI is, in many cases, given access to them too, but they have much more limited amounts and are generally too stupid to abuse them to the same extent as a player.</li>
                            <li>Use of items outside of battle is considered fine however, the player is almost always able to go back to the Pokemon Center anyways.</li>
                            <li>Some people ban the use of equipped items, although depending on the game the AI also has them and takes advantage of them properly, and the provide more variety in strategy for battles.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Ban the use of boosting moves</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>So called boosting moves like Calm Mide and Dragon Dance, especially when combined with the AI's reluctance to switch on a bad matchup where they can't do damage as the player clicks Swords Dance, are considered by a large portion of the community as OP. Almost anything can beat almost any trainer in almost any game with the help of a boosting move or two, and the player can take advantage of it much more than the AI can, thus why so many people ban them.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Ban the gaining of EVs</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Effort values (or EVs for short) are a complicated mechanic, but to simplify, knocking out a Pokemon will give you an EV for whatever stat that Pokemon gives EVs for (Machop gives attack EVs for instance). Any given stat can have, at max, 252 evs in, and any Pokemon can have 508, which lets you max out 2 stats. At high enough levels, a maxed out stat is effectively like a +1 boost, and the trainer Pokemon in any game before gen 7 do not have them, so it comes across as another somewhat unfair advantage.</li>
                            <li>People choosing to play without EVs often play on ROMs of the games patched to remove the ability to gain EVs from the player to remove the annoyance of manually removing EVs with EV reducing berries.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p class="WordsWordsWords">Many of you may have noticed that I am reluctant to use absolutes in this description, that's because there is a large amount of gatekeeping within the Nuzlocking community. Whatever rules are the most fun for you are the ones that you should play with, this website is meerly a suggestion and guiding hand for those looking into starting your first Nuzlocke. Nuzlocking is incredibly fun and you should NOT let someone else take that away from you.</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p class="WordsWordsWords">Blaze Black and Volt White (for future reference I will be only refering to Blaze Black, but that's ok because these are the same game) are ROM hacks of Black and White made by the prolific ROM hacker Drayano. They feature the ability to obtain all 649 Pokemon at the time, increased difficulty, base stat and type Changes big and small to many Pokemon, tons of boss battles in a variety of formats, and overall, just incredible game design. I beat this game using hardcore Nuzlocke and no EVs rules on my 11th full attempt, which was only my 2nd to reach the champion. It has earned it's place as my favorite Pokemon ROM hack due to how incredible it is for nuzlocking (I'm pretty sure unintentionally). However, I would not reccomend this as your first hack to play because it requires serious amounts of focus, skill, and planning, and can actually be quite RNG based at times due to faulty gen 5 AI. For those who think they have the skills however, this is a great game and I can help guide you through the first couple of gyms.</p>
                <h2>Chili, Cilan, and Cress (But probably Cress)</h2>

                <p class="WordsWordsWords">The first decision in the run, and arguably one of the more important ones is the starter. Snivy is the most popular starter in the community, partially because it has a cheesy strategy for the second gym leader, Lenora, but moreso because of the elemental monkey that comes with it. See, each starter in this game comes with an elemental monkey of the type that they are good against, (Water monkey for Snivy, grass monkey for Tepig, fire monkey for Oshawott), and the water monkey is by far the best of the three for lategame, because it gets the move water spout which can completely invalidate certain tough boss battles. The starter I have the least experience with (which is to say none) is Oshawott, I know that fire monkey is great for the third gym leader, but both Samurott and fire monkey fall off hard after that, and that makes Elesa and Clay much more difficult. The starter I think is the best is Tepig, it does get the worst monkey by a long shot, but it makes up for that in spades with a huge matchup against Lenora, Burgh, Elesa, and Skyla, not to mention just random grunt battles which can be tough. It has a fairly consistent early game too, so I'd argue that Tepig is the best pick, though they are all viable.</p>
                <p class="WordsWordsWords">If you get bad encounters early game, just reset because it's not worth the time. On route 1 you want Lillipup or Starly especially, but Zigzagoon, Pidgey, Bidoof, Rattata, and Hoothoot can also be good. The worst encounter here is either Bidoof with the ability moody or Rattata with the ability hustle. Don't try to delay for 10% feebas, it's not worth it.</p>
                <p class="WordsWordsWords">Route 2 has a lot of pretty good Pokemon that you will want, like Caterpie, Weedle, Kricketot, Wurmple (if it turns into Dustox), Meowth, Spearow, Poochyena, or even Purrloin. Do note however, that a lot of the encounters here have one really good ability and one really bad one, for instance Butterfree without compound eyes is kind of useless.</p>
                <p class="WordsWordsWords">Dreamyard is where you get a guaranteed monkey encounter, this is what you will use to sweep the first gym leader easily. If you're running with Snivy your monkey is incredibly important so you may just want to reset if it has bad IVs, or the ability torrent instead of gluttony (which turns into unburden). And that's it, you only get four Pokemon in total before the first gym, but that's fine because monkey spamming whatever it's best STAB move is should clean up easily. The trainers (especially Cheren) in this split can be decently challenging, but just remember the level cap is 14 so you can be pretty generous with your levels.</p>
                <h2>Lenora</h2>

                <p class="WordsWordsWords">Beating one of the spice boys gives you access to the next split of the game which includes 4 more encounters but also one of the major early gatekeepers in Lenora. Be wary of some random battles here as well, the grunts in the Dreamyard and in Wellspring cave can kill some of your Pokemon if you're not careful.</p>
                <p class="WordsWordsWords">You get the fishing rod from beating the Wellspring grunts which unlocks and encounter in Striaton, ideally you want Slowpoke (either ability), but Staryu is also phenominal, and even Psyduck can be pretty damn good, especially with cloud nine and a good speed IV. In Wellspring cave you want a bat, either Zu or Woo is fine, both are huge for the incredibly difficult third gym. Other encounters like Aron, Geodude, or Roggenrola are also pretty good however. If you get Whismur than all I feel for you is pity.</p>
                <p class="WordsWordsWords">Route 3 is pretty important for the rest of the encounter routing in the run. You could go for early Audino to get a chance at fire starter in Pinwheel forest, but I don't think that's worth it, you should probably just go in the doubles grass. Really most things here are good, so you just want anything other than Blitzle, Pidove, or thick fat Marill. It should be noted that this guide assumes you are not playing with "Pinwheel clause" (a clause that separates Pinwheel Forest inside and outside into two separate encounters), because they are both counted as the same area in the game. You once again just want to go in doubles grass for the best chance at Sawk or Throh, and nothing else you can find is actively bad or anything, even Dunsparce. Sawk specifically actually has certain practical applications in the Elite Four.</p>
                <p class="WordsWordsWords">In terms of battles in this split, Lenora is the big one, though the previously mentioned grunts and the random scientist in Lenora's gym can give you some trouble. Cheren on route 3 is really easy if you didn't lose anything earlier because you should have a balanced enough team to handle him. The only other boss fight this split is N, which can actually be pretty tricky, he has a drought Vulpix to cover for his water-weak teamates, and a Zorua that can easily pursuit trap and kill your Pokemon if you aren't careful. Drizzle Slowpoke is huge here, though it is susceptible to pursuit. Generally you just want to choose a good lead and then play the fight out, there isn't much planning you really can do.</p>
                <p class="WordsWordsWords">But of course, the fight I keep mentioning is Lenora: a tricky double battle against strong Normal types that can deal huge damage with boosted retaliates. The cheese strategy here is to lead with contrary Servine into her two intimidate Pokemon, which will end up giving Servine +2 attack, and then have Simipour use tickle on Servine as well to boost Servine by +1 attack and defense each turn. You want to use leech seed on Herdier with Servine to keep healthy and because the Herdier is so weak the fight can become more or less a 2v1. At +2 or 3, even +4 depending on how the fight plays out, your Servine should be knocking Lenora's Pokemon out with just one or two cuts (cut is a 60 base power 100% accurate grass move in this game). You need to have kept tackle on Servine and equipped a normal gem before the fight because the Bouffalant has sap sipper, which makes it completely immune to grass moves, and that is the only way to consistently knock it out quickly due to it's sizeable natural bulk.</p>
                <p class="WordsWordsWords">Pignite, on the other hand, can't cheese the fight to quite the same degree, but if you lead with something else to soak up the intimidates, and then switch in Pignite, set up a flame charge boost, and give minor support with something like Dustox or Butterfree, then you can sweep through most of the fight, though more improvising will need to be done. Though I do not have much first hand experience with Dewott, I can only assume the process is similar to Pignite because Dewott gets STAB boosted karate chop. Sawk or Throh can also provide similar roles, or just make the fights safer. A good Sawk can one-shot Bouffalant with fighting gem boosted double kick.</p>
                <p class="WordsWordsWords">And just like that, you beat Lenora, arguably one of the hardest parts of the game, you're ready to do the rest now. But don't get cocky, it's not like the rest of the game is a breeze or anything.</p>
